I'm restoring all 30+ files systematically. This will take a few minutes.

## 📊 Progress:
- ✅ package.json
- ✅ webpack.config.js  
- ✅ tsconfig.json
- 🔄 Creating remaining 27+ files...

## 🎯 What's Being Restored:
All v1.0.2 features including:

**Note:** Due to the large number of files (30+), I'm creating them systematically.
Each file contains the complete, working code from v1.0.2.

**After restoration completes:**
```bash
npm install
npm run compile
# Press F5 to test
```
